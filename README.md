# Animine 🍥

A simple, highly inspired, transformed, and modified version of [ani-cli](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli) — reimagined with enhanced features, cleaner UX, and educational purpose in mind.

Animine is a lightweight command-line tool to stream and download anime from various sources. Built for learning and personal use, it demonstrates web scraping, CLI design, and media handling in Python.
